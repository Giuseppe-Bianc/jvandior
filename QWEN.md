# jvandior Project Context

## Project Overview
jvandior is a programming language written in Java. It's a Gradle-based Java application project that was initially generated using the Gradle 'init' task. The project follows a standard Java project structure with separate directories for source code and tests.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Language**: Java
- **Build System**: Gradle (with Kotlin DSL - `.kts` files)
- **Project Type**: Application (CLI-focused)
- **Main Package**: `org.dersbian`
- **Java Version**: Targeting Java 25 (based on toolchain configuration)

### Architecture:
- Single-module project with a root `jvandior` module containing an `app` subproject
- Standard Maven-style directory structure (`src/main/java`, `src/test/java`)
- Configuration files include `settings.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`, and `gradle.properties`

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 25 (as specified in the toolchain configuration)
- Gradle (the project includes a Gradle wrapper for convenience)

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Build the project (compile and create JAR)
./gradlew build

# Run the application
./gradlew run

# Run tests only
./gradlew test

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew clean

# Build and run integration tests
./gradlew check
```

### Using the Gradle Wrapper:
The project includes a Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` on Unix, `gradlew.bat` on Windows) which ensures consistent builds across different environments by downloading and using a specific Gradle version.

## Development Conventions

### Code Structure:
- Main application code is located in `app/src/main/java/org/dersbian/App.java`
- Test code is located in `app/src/test/java/org/dersbian/AppTest.java`
- Resources would go in `app/src/main/resources` and `app/src/test/resources`

### Testing:
- Uses JUnit Jupiter for unit testing
- Tests follow standard JUnit 5 conventions with `@Test` annotations
- Includes basic assertion testing with `assertNotNull`

### Dependencies:
- Uses Guava library (implementation dependency)
- JUnit Jupiter for testing framework
- Gradle configuration cache is enabled for faster builds

### Naming Conventions:
- Package name: `org.dersbian` (appears to be a personal/fictional domain)
- Main class: `App` (standard for generated Gradle projects)
- Test class: `AppTest` (following convention of ClassNameTest)

## Current State
The project currently contains a basic "Hello World!" application generated by the Gradle init task. The main `App` class has a simple `getGreeting()` method that returns "Hello World!" and a `main` method that prints this greeting. The corresponding test verifies that the greeting is not null.

As a programming language implementation project, this appears to be in early stages, with the basic project infrastructure established but minimal actual language functionality implemented yet.

## Files and Directories:
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Defines the project structure and included modules
- `build.gradle.kts` (in app/) - Contains build configuration, dependencies, and application plugin setup
- `gradle.properties` - Contains Gradle-specific properties (configuration cache enabled)
- `app/src/main/java/org/dersbian/App.java` - Main application class
- `app/src/test/java/org/dersbian/AppTest.java` - Unit tests for the application
- `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper scripts for platform-independent execution
